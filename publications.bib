  abstract={Anomaly detection in network traffic is crucial for maintaining the security of computer networks and identifying malicious activities. Most approaches to anomaly detection use methods based on forecasting. Extensive real-world network datasets for forecasting and anomaly detection techniques are missing, potentially causing overestimation of anomaly detection algorithm performance and fabricating the illusion of progress. This manuscript tackles this issue by introducing a comprehensive dataset derived from 40 weeks of traffic transmitted by 275,000 active IP addresses in the CESNET3 network—an ISP network serving approximately half a million customers daily. It captures the behavior of diverse network entities, reflecting the variability typical of an ISP environment. This variability provides a realistic and challenging environment for developing forecasting and anomaly detection models, enabling evaluations that are closer to real-world deployment scenarios. It provides valuable insights into the practical deployment of forecast-based anomaly detection approaches.},

  abstract={Network traffic monitoring based on IP Flows is a standard monitoring approach that can be deployed to various network infrastructures, even the large ISP networks connecting millions of people. Since flow records traditionally contain only limited information (addresses, transport ports, and amount of exchanged data), they are also commonly extended by additional features that enable network traffic analysis with high accuracy. These flow extensions are, however, often too large or hard to compute, which then allows only offline analysis or limits their deployment only to smaller-sized networks. This paper proposes a novel extended IP flow called NetTiSA (Network Time Series Analysed) flow, based on analysing the time series of packet sizes. By thoroughly testing 25 different network traffic classification tasks, we show the broad applicability and high usability of NetTiSA flow. For practical deployment, we also consider the sizes of flows extended by NetTiSA features and evaluate the performance impacts of their computation in the flow exporter. The novel features proved to be computationally inexpensive and showed excellent discriminatory performance. The trained machine learning classifiers with proposed features mostly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. NetTiSA finally bridges the gap and brings universal, small-sized, and computationally inexpensive features for traffic classification that can be scaled up to extensive monitoring infrastructures, bringing the machine learning traffic classification even to 100 Gbps backbone lines.},

  abstract={Network traffic monitoring using IP flows is used to handle the current challenge of analyzing encrypted network communication. Nevertheless, the packet aggregation into flow records naturally causes information loss; therefore, this paper proposes a novel flow extension for traffic features based on the time series analysis of the Single Flow Time series, i.e., a time series created by the number of bytes in each packet and its timestamp. We propose 69 universal features based on the statistical analysis of data points, time domain analysis, packet distribution within the flow timespan, time series behavior, and frequency domain analysis. We have demonstrated the usability and universality of the proposed feature vector for various network traffic classification tasks using 15 well-known publicly available datasets. Our evaluation shows that the novel feature vector achieves classification performance similar or better than related works on both binary and multiclass classification tasks. In more than half of the evaluated tasks, the classification performance increased by up to 5 %.}

The paper deals with detection of periodic behavioral patterns of the communication that can be detected using time series created from network traffic by autocorrelation function and Lomb-Scargle periodogram. The revealed characteristics of the periodic behavior can be further exploited to recognize particular applications. We have experimented with the created dataset of 61 classes, and trained a machine learning classifier based on XGBoost that performed the best in our experiments, reaching 90% F1-score.},

Contrary to the currently used approaches, this paper presents Unevenly Spaced Time Series (USTS) as a feasible representation of network traffic with several brilliant benefits for analysis. The article concerns several types of USTS. A dataset captured on a real ISP network was created to evaluate the properties of USTS. The dataset contains over 35 million time series. We experimentaly proved the USTS is suitable for network traffic analysis and allow automatic processing, e.g., to classify network traffic.},

This study focuses on the CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset, derived from one year of TLS network traffic on the CESNET2 backbone.

  abstract={Traffic monitoring is important for supporting network security and management. Recent advancements have explored machine learning-based approaches to classify encrypted traffic, yet the challenge of obtaining current threat datasets persists, leaving supervised models reliant on outdated information. Outlier detection, which identifies anomalous network behavior without requiring labeled data, addresses this limitation by flagging suspicious deviations from expected patterns. This paper proposes a novel Network Outlier Detection System (NODS), a platform based on open-source software designed to detect outliers in network traffic by leveraging forecasting models. Our system was deployed and tested on a large ISP infrastructure. The evaluation of detected outliers over a one-month period showed key insights into system performance and provided valuable lessons for future deployment of outlier detection methods. This paper details the architecture of NODS, deployment, and performance while highlighting the challenges and lessons learned in building an effective outlier detection system for network traffic.},

This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with an anomaly detection framework to enhance explainability in network traffic analysis. Instead of directly detecting anomalies, the LLM only interprets already flagged anomaly events, providing insights into their potential root causes. Our method reduces LLM over-usage while improving decision-making for security analysts. We evaluated our approach using real-world network traffic data, demonstrating its ability to enhance situational awareness, reduce false positives, and support more effective cybersecurity practices.},

Until recently, the lack of large-scale, real-world datasets limited the fair evaluation of forecasting methods. The newly released CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset addresses this gap by providing multivariate traffic data from thousands of devices over 40 weeks at multiple aggregation granularities and hierarchy levels. In this study, we leverage the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset to conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models and provide practical insights. Moreover, our analysis reveals trade-offs between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across different levels of granularity. Beyond model comparison, we establish a transparent and reproducible benchmarking framework, releasing source code and experiments to encourage standardized evaluation and accelerate progress in network traffic forecasting research.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic inspection is a challenging domain and trained models may degrade soon after deployment. Besides biases present during data captures and model creation, data drifts contribute significantly to ML model degradation. This paper proposes a novel method called Model-based Feature Weight Drift Detection (MFWDD) for concept drift detection. It is a part of a public software framework suited for dataset drift analysis tailored to the domain of network traffic. This work addresses TLS and QUIC service classification problems, examines a variety of experiments analyzing the evolution of the respective distributions, and observes their degradation over time on different ML features. The MFWDD framework guided TLS and QUIC services classification models retraining throughout an extensive period and not only prevented model degradation but also improved its performance and consistency over time.},

The threat actors commonly use computational resources of companies, research and educational institutions, or end users. In this paper, we analyzed the long-term periodic behavior of the cryptocurrency miners communicating in computer networks. We propose a novel method for cryptominers detection using specially designed periodicity features. The detection algorithm is based on the mathematical detection of periodic Flow time series (FTS) and feature mining. Altogether with the Machine Learning technique, the resulting system achieves high-precision performance. Furthermore, our approach enhances a flow-based cryptominers detection system DeCrypto to further improve its reliability and feasibility for high-speed networks.},

We propose Device Annotation Framework (DAF), a modular and extensible open-source framework for annotating large-scale network datasets with operating system and device type labels. To improve annotation precision in complex environments, DAF combines multiple independent annotation sources by label fusion and conflict resolution. We evaluate DAF on a ground truth dataset collected from a mid-sized network and demonstrate its capability to produce high-quality annotations.},

We present a novel approach for botnet detection based on the inherent periodic communication patterns of C&C channels. Leveraging the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we identify periodic behaviour in multiflow time series and extract periodic-based features for classification using machine learning. To address limitations in existing datasets, we introduce CESNET-CC25, a comprehensive and publicly available dataset comprising real-world botnet C&C traffic and benign traffic collected from an ISP backbone and controlled laboratory settings. Our method achieves high precision across both the widely used CTU-13 dataset and CESNET-CC25, with significant improvements in recall on long-duration captures. The results demonstrate that periodicity is a reliable indicator of C&C behaviour, even in modern, encrypted network environments, and that CESNET-CC25 provides a realistic benchmark for future botnet detection research.},

  abstract={Time Series Analysis (TSA) is an essential tool in computer networking, supporting tasks such as traffic forecasting, capacity planning, load balancing, quality of service monitoring, behavior profiling, and anomaly detection. Despite its widespread use, the community was limited by the lack of sufficient datasets. Our recent dataset, CESNET-TimeSeries24, finally fills this gap. However, its substantial size presents significant challenges for practical use in research. Therefore, inspired by the other machine learning communities that often develop supportive tools and benchmarks to accelerate research, we introduced a CESNET TS-Zoo library. It is designed to streamline dataset management, experiment setting, and reproducibility in the TSA of network traffic. TS-Zoo provides a standardized API for accessing the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset and includes methods for time series preprocessing, multiple dataset partitioning, and data loading for experiments. Furthermore, the preprocessing steps can be exported and imported, enabling reproducible experiments. Therefore, the TS-Zoo library simplifies TSA experiments and enables reproducibility of TSA research applied in computer networking.},
